** Project name: Memory Matching Game

** Project repository: bethanyv@bitbucket.org/bethanyv/teamproject.git

** Team members: Kristine Stecker, Bethany Van Meter

** Description (1-3 paragraphs):

We want to create a digital memory game (like the card game). Players can choose the
number of matches they would like, from 2 to 32 (a 2x2 board to a 8x8). 

Players then input the position of the card they want to flip. If it's the first card, 
it stays flipped until they select a second. Once a second is chosen, it's either a 
match or not. If it is a match, the cards stay flipped.

When the game starts, the player can choose to play against the computer or against 
another player. Then the game will continue based on that! If it's player vs. player
then it'll switch each guess. The program will keep track of how many matches each player
has. Game will continue until player chooses to terminate or all matches are used.

** Implementation approach:

We plan to use C++, and a type of pop-up graphic we learn in the course of this class.
We plan to meet every Thursday at minimum for a couple of hours.

Week 1: Work on header file to organize all of our classes and functions needed. (What we will need)
Week 2: Check in, evaluate what needs to be done from there. Goal is to have the board set up by now
with cards placed and hidden and what not.
Week 3: Have graphics done/visuals done. Have most logic done for the board, and turns between players or computer
Week 4: finish up AI logic for computer and anything else left that we haven't gotten to
Week 5: Testing/Quality control. Find bugs, test, finish up loose ends, make sure code is commented well. Practice presentation A LOT.

** Risk management plan (max 1 paragraph): If the graphics implementation fails to work as expected,
we might need to change the way we visually respresent our cards. Backup plan is ASCII art for the cards.
